## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

-  Node.js (version 14 or above)
-  npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Installation

To install and set up the app created with Create React App, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```
   $ cd your-project-directory
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using either npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

## Running the App

To run the ReactJS app locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are still in the project directory in your terminal.
2. Start the development server using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   $ yarn start
   ```

   This will start the development server and automatically open the app in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access the app by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

3. You should now see your ReactJS app up and running!
